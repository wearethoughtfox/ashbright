The choice of paper size is one of the  first of any given work to be printed. There are two basic paper size systems in the world: the international A sizes, and the American sizes.

The international Standard paper sizes, called the A series, is based
on a golden rectangle, the divine proportion. It is extremely handsome
and practical as well. It is adopted by many countries around the world
and is based on the German DIN metric Standards. The United States uses
a basic letter size (8 1/2 x 11‚Äù) of ugly proportions, and results in
complete chaos with an endless amount of paper sizes. It is a
by-product of the culture of free enterprise, competition and waste.
Just another example of the misinterpretations of freedom.
